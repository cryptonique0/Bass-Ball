================================================================================
                              HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

DURING MATCH (0-90 minutes):
  1. Player performs action (shoot, pass, tackle, sprint)
  2. Match engine updates gameState
  3. Statistics are recorded in matchStats
  4. Event is added to events log
  5. UI displays live stats and event log

AT 90 MINUTES:
  1. Match engine reaches gameTime >= 90
  2. LiveMatch detects end of match
  3. Component switches from match controls to MatchResults
  4. MatchResults component mounts

RESULTS DISPLAY:
  1. MatchResults parses events log
  2. Extracts player statistics
  3. Calculates MVP (by goals → assists → impact)
  4. Renders beautiful summary screen
  5. User can restart via button

GOAL SCORING WITH ASSISTS:
  1. Player shoots successfully
  2. scoreGoal() called
  3. findLastPasser() searches recent passes
  4. Assist maker found and credited
  5. Event recorded with assist information
  6. Both stats updated (goal + assist)

================================================================================
                              QUICK START
================================================================================

TO USE THE SYSTEM:
  1. Play a match normally (0-90 minutes)
  2. At 90 minutes, match automatically ends
  3. Beautiful results screen appears automatically
  4. View final score, statistics, and MVP
  5. Click "Return to Menu" to restart

TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM:
  1. Read MATCH_RESULTS_QUICK_REF.md (10 min)
  2. Read MATCH_RESULTS_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md (10 min)
  3. Read MATCH_RESULTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md (20 min)

TO CUSTOMIZE:
  1. See MATCH_RESULTS_QUICK_REF.md "Customization Options"
  2. Modify components/MatchResults.tsx as needed
  3. See MATCH_RESULTS_CODE_REFERENCE.md for exact code locations
